            St. Jone’s Convent School was founded in the year 1986 with the vision and mission to provide education at
            the highest standards while being all inclusive, catering to students from all walks of life and all the
            localities of the city.<br><br>

            Bishop Anthony Lobo, who after serving as the Principal of School for Boys, Karachi was serving as the
            Principal of St Patrick’s High School. Bishop Lobo saw the need to establish St. John’s Convent School as to
            compliment the blooming growth of Karachi as the city expanded outwards and upwards.<br><br>

            Groundbreaking and construction began in 1984-5, and the School started functioning in 1986. The first day
            of the school was 23rd November 1986. The school occupies the same premises it occupies today.<br><br>

            The school had humble beginnings; its first batch of students numbered 600. The growth of the school matched
            the growth of the city till the school reached its maximum capacity. Today almost 3,500 students study in
            the school in Morning and Afternoon shifts.<br><br>

            True to its mission and the vision of the founding Principal, St. Jone’s Convent School caters to students
            from all walks of life living in different parts of Karachi. The love and passion of Bishop Lobo for
            imparting education at the highest standards and thus contributing to the building of Pakistan as a nation
            is shared by and is being continued by Mr. Peter A. Misquita and Ms. Seema Naiyer the school’s Principal and
            Deputy Principal.<br><br>

            Admissions to the school are highly competitive yet needs blind. The number of students being admitted to
            the school each year is only limited by the school’s infrastructure capacity. The school offers scholarships
            to students who qualify for admission in the school and belong to low-income families who cannot afford to
            educate them. The school also offers scholarships as an incentive for outstanding and exceptional
            educational performances and extracurricular activities.<br><br>

            Each year about 250 students complete their early education from the school and move to their university
            education and nascent stages of their professional lives taking with them the rich, inclusive culture of the
            school and add to the school’s growing heritage and join the ever growing numbers and ranks of the school’s
            alumni, which as of 2019 numbered almost 22,000.<br><br>
